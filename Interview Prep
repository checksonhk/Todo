Why did I decide to use the MVC architecture ?

First, its a widely used architecture, and I support the speration of concern logic, ie. each component does one thing and only one thing. This allows for my code to be easily understanable by others. 

Models - Model objects are parts of the application that implement logic for the applications data. eg, in the case of the ToDo API, it manages all queries to the PSQL database.
Views - Views are the components that display the user interface. eg. the UI is often created from the model data. 
Controllers - Controllers are the components that handle and repond to user input and interaction
