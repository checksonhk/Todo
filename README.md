Introduction 

Hi Iâ€™m Jackson and I graduated from University of Toronto in 2019 with a degree in Physics. My interests are in software development stems from a strong problem solving background as well as having the ability to create beautiful performant products with delightful user experiences.

Back in school, I started a start-up called Peau wtih a 4 cofounders from various backgrounds, Peau aimed to provide community based recommendations for beauty products. It received over 1000 beta users and is currently still in alpha used by 150 people. It is built using a modern web technology stack - React, Redux, Jest, Babel, webpack and supported with by machine learning processed on python.

Why did I decide to use the MVC architecture ?

First, its a widely used architecture, and I support the speration of concern logic, ie. each component does one thing and only one thing. This allows for my code to be easily understanable by others. 

Models - Model objects are parts of the application that implement logic for the applications data. eg, in the case of the ToDo API, it manages all queries to the PSQL database.
Views - Views are the components that display the user interface. eg. the UI is often created from the model data. 
Controllers - Controllers are the components that handle and repond to user input and interaction

Why NorthOne ?

Because this is a product, I wish I had when I was part of Peau (my start-up).  Managing expesnese / bookkeeping would take up unnecessary amounts of time, which could have been used of further developing/polishing our product, a particularly useful product I see for SMBs are the insights provided into revenue and expenses, as this was one of the glaring issues we had. North One's platforms allow businesses to connect with consumers in a more seamless way than ever before, and it is through APIs that this transition will become prominent that tranditional banks


From reading reviews of the company culture, it seems like I will having by opinion values and voice heard even though I will be a Jr, which is one of the very attractive parts of NorthOne, as well the ability to be surrounded by people with such a diverse background from an engagement manager to a memeber of Team Canada's Dragon Boat Team as well as other BootCamp Grads. Which in turn, I think will provide a much better environement for me to be exposed to the world of software development. 

Technology-wise, I think that the ciriculum taugt at Lighthouse perfectly fits with the stack used at NorthOne, so while I might still be a Jr. Developer. This is the perfect oppotunity for me to demonstrate the 3 months I've dedicated to learning this tech Stack. While also further mastering my craft, as 3 months simply isn't enough to completely master JS. 

I see the value in providing insights into the financial health of small business. I think what North One does particularly well is how it sells technology to a target audience which often lacks funds to purchase or create financial management tools. To me, seems to have the 'for the people by the people' motto which I strongly resonate well with. I see the company's goal as one of the next steps in digital banking platform, which online banks becoming, more and more popular, and I want to be part of this journey.


If you had more time, what would I do differently?
- optimize, solutions such that they work more efficiently
- learn to take better advantage or pg-promise, to use custom type formatting

Why did I use the datastructure / PSQL?
- What I was familiar with/ most comfortable with
I used a SQL dataabse instead of a noSQL databse becuase most of the information stored for this TODO have strict relationships which makes SQL ideal

If I was working with another person, How would I split the work?
- I would have wanted to split it the work by feature, instead of back-end, front-end right now as I still want to develop my skills and not specicialize in one or another

if they decided to bring me on full time after internship, what would change?
- I hope that as the intership finishes up, I would have already been a vital member of the team, in the sense that my responsibilites would only increase. By that time I would also like to be able to mentor new interns, as I would have had a strongly understanding of their journey.



Questions for Them ?
- How to do see North One growing?, what are the majors plans for this year, ... what would the position entail ( what sort of work?, what would the heirachy be like? )
- Why is is America's Challenger Bank, when its a Toronto based company ?
